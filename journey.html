    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Delmas Mathis. I'm 24 years old, a creative developer and 3D artist with a passion for building interactive experiences, from immersive AR/VR applications to web-based games and custom 3D models.<br>Iâ€™m currently based in the south of France and fully mobile by car, with intermediate English proficiency and a strong commitment to continuous learning.

      <br><br>

      <strong>ðŸŽ“ Education & Training</strong><br>
      I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Licence Informatique), completed in 2024 at the UniversitÃ© Champollion in Albi. Prior to that, I earned two professional titles:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Concepteur et DÃ©veloppeur d'Applications (BAC+3)</strong> â€“ Webforce3, Toulouse (2021)</li>
        <li><strong>Technicien SupÃ©rieur en SystÃ¨mes et RÃ©seaux</strong> â€“ Simplon / Greta, Castres (2020)</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <strong>ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience</strong><br>
      In 2021, I completed a year-long work-study program with <strong>Purple Reality</strong> in Lubersac, where I worked on the design and development of AR and VR applications using <strong>Unity</strong>. I also explored tools like <strong>PlayCanvas</strong> for WebGL development and <strong>After Effects</strong> for visual production. It was a key experience that helped me bridge technical development with visual creativity.

      <br><br>

      In 2020, as part of my TSSR training, I interned at <strong>Ariane Network (acquired by CELESTE)</strong> in Albi, working on network schematics and router configuration giving me a strong foundation in IT systems and infrastructure.

      <br><br>

      <strong>ðŸ§  Skills & Tools</strong><br>
      I have a multidisciplinary skill set combining development and digital creation:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Unity (C#), Godot (GDScript), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, back-end & database basics</li>
        <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Blender</li>
        <li><strong>2D Design & Editing:</strong> GIMP, Photoshop</li>
        <li><strong>Video Editing:</strong> CutShot</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Editing:</strong> Audacity</li>
        <li><strong>Office Tools:</strong> LibreOffice (Writer, Calc)</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <strong>ðŸŒŸ My Vision</strong><br>
      I see technology as a canvas for creativity. Whether itâ€™s developing a web app, crafting a 3D scene, or designing a gameplay experience, every project is an opportunity to learn and improve.<br> I aim to keep building tools, games, and visual content that are interactive, accessible, and visually engaging.

      <br><br>

      Iâ€™m currently open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and full-time roles where I can contribute as a developer, technical artist, or creative technologist. Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:delmatpm@orange.fr">delmatpm@orange.fr</a> if youâ€™d like to work together.
